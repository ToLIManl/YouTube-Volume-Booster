This is a script for TamperMonkey.
It allows you to increase the volume of Youtube videos above 100%.
To the left of the start button there will be a "Volume Booster" button; when you press it, a volume slider will appear on the left; when you click on "Volume Booster" again, the slider disappears.
To install the script, you need to create a new script in TamperMonkey and paste the code there.
